### About this Project

Detection of synthetic voice manipulation refers to the process of identifying whether an audio recording or voice sample has been artificially generated or altered using computer-generated techniques. With the advancement of technology, it has become possible to create highly realistic synthetic voices that can mimic human speech patterns and intonations. However, these synthetic voices can also be misused for malicious purposes, such as creating fake audio recordings to spread misinformation.
